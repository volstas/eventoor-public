# Premise
I've made eventoor.com primary to learn SvelteKit, Cloudflare and just as an opportunity to test tools and libraries I haven't tried before. 
I also wanted to build something end-to-end, from nothing to fully functioning and deployed in production.

As for what it is - it solves a simple issue, sharing dates in a global world. I was frustrated every time I saw a tweet, a post, discord message, etc. saying that something will happen at X time in Y timezone. It made no sense to me to ask people to convert timezones. So my goal was to build a free, super simple, quick way to create and share these type of events. As a bonus added calendar integration so people can easily add it to the calendar of their choice and get notified within their native workflow.

# Open source?
I didn't really build it for open source so I won't make it public but will elaborate on the architecture here

# Tools used
- SvelteKit
Primary framework I wanted to learn. I love the way reactivity is done and the runes system. Plus I was very curious about an framework that does both - frontend and backend, instead of the usual separation where frontend is done in React/Vue and the backend is in Node.js or non javascript framework. SvelteKit felt like a very elegant way to do both.
